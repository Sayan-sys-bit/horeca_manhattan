# 🚀 Data-Driven Go-To-Market Strategy for a Scalable HoReCa Venture

## 📌 Project Overview
This project delivers a data-driven, execution-ready strategy for launching a new HoReCa (Hotel, Restaurant & Catering) venture in a highly competitive digital food service market.

Using real insights from the **Zomato Restaurant Dataset**, this study evaluates:
- Market attractiveness and pricing structures
- Demand & popularity distribution across cuisines and cities
- Channel-specific performance (Delivery vs. Dining)
- Quality thresholds that unlock pricing power
- Operational scaling through micro-market expansion

The goal is to transform raw market data into **actionable strategic decisions** that ensure:
✅ High customer satisfaction  
✅ Profit-focused pricing  
✅ Fast scaling with reduced risk

## 🎯 Key Strategic Insights — “The Launch Blueprint”

### ✅ Market & Pricing Strategy
- **Value Engineering Advantage**  
  Products must be priced **below** the market’s Price/Vote ratio to:
  - Increase perceived value
  - Accelerate user adoption during initial growth

- **Mandatory Rating Threshold: 4.0+**  
  A minimum **4.0 rating** is essential to:
  - Compete effectively (as low-rated markets don’t exist)
  - Justify premium pricing without perception penalty

---

### ✅ Location Selection & Expansion Plan
- **City Selection Based on Price-to-Value Fit**  
  Since rating levels are universally high across major cities, pricing environment and item volume become the decision drivers.

- **Micro-Market Penetration for Scale**  
  Growth must target **low-saturation zones** near high-demand clusters to:
  - Capture organic customer spillover
  - Limit promotional spending

---

### ✅ Operational Channel Strategy
- **Delivery and Dining metrics are independent**
  - Performance excellence in one does **not** guarantee success in the other

- **Operational Focus: SINGLE-Channel Dominance**
  - Launch strategy should be either **Delivery-First** or **Dining-First**
  - Allocate **80%** of initial investments to that primary channel
